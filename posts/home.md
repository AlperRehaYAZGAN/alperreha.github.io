I am a software developer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include DevOps, CI/CD Pipelines and Cloud Computing. In development I mainly use Go and Node.js.

I am currently working as a software developer at Turk Telekom via Gantek. I am also a student at Yildiz Technical University.
